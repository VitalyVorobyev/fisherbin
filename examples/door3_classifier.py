"""Shared logic and committed evidence for the door3-classifier documentation page.

A two-component Gaussian mixture (`signal_pdf`, `background_pdf`) is separated
by a small `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` classifier whose
calibrated posteriors become component density ratios and then scores through
`scorequant.DensityRatioScore.from_classifier`. `exact_provider` builds the
analytic Bayes-optimal score for the same mixture, which is what makes the
retention ladder in `run_ladder` an honest comparison instead of a guess, and
what lets `run_study` add an exact-provider *ceiling* row: the same fit at
the same bin budget, with no classifier in the loop at all.

This is also the one library example that measures what an *estimated*
density-ratio score reports about itself (`information_kind ==
"supplied_score_surrogate"`, `ScoreProvenance.exact_fisher is False`) against
what it actually achieves relative to the known analytic score -- the
surrogate-information caveat `docs/book/ch13-estimated-scores.md` describes
in prose. `run_study` records that measurement as committed evidence at
`docs/examples/assets/door3-classifier.json`, alongside the existing figure
`docs/examples/assets/door3-classifier.png`. This module backs both the
notebook (`examples/notebooks/door3_classifier.ipynb`) and the docs page.

    """The wrong-measure closure residual, kept as a deliberate, labelled contrast.

    `ratio_closure_report`'s contract (`src/scorequant/ratios.py`) is that
    `weights` must carry the reference measure of the ratio *denominator* --
    here the balanced 0.5/0.5 training mixture, never the 0.3/0.7 reference
    mixture events are actually drawn from. This record shows what the check
    reports when handed that wrong measure anyway, so a reader who makes the
    same mistake can recognise it rather than mistake it for a working
    diagnostic.

    wrong_measure_residual

    analytic_reference_measure_ratio_means
        The exact, quadrature (not sampled) reference-measure mean of each

        estimator, computed independently of any random draw.

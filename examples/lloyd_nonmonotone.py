"""The unguarded batch Mahalanobis-Lloyd step, and what the guard does instead.

This script is the single deterministic generator behind the
`docs/examples/lloyd-nonmonotone.md` page. It runs

* the committed eight-row counterexample: one frozen-metric batch relabeling
  that lowers `log det` of the binned information while improving the
  frozen-metric distortion it actually minimizes, together with the unguarded
  iteration continued to its own fixed point;
* the same eight rows under `scorequant.MahalanobisLloydConfig` with
  `guard="reject"` and with `guard="exchange"`, which is the acceptance trace
  the page publishes;
* a failure-mode ledger: many unguarded runs from random starting labels across
  three synthetic problems, three sample sizes, and two bin budgets, counting
  how many of them ever step downhill and how many vacate a cell entirely;
* one large guarded run from random starting labels, so the batch phase has
  real work to do and the handoff to the exact exchange is visible;

and writes `docs/examples/assets/lloyd-nonmonotone.json` plus
`docs/examples/assets/lloyd-nonmonotone.png`.

"""Execute every Python snippet the portal publishes.

Two surfaces, one contract -- a published snippet runs, and it produces a
fitted result rather than merely parsing.

``website/get-started/index.mdx`` shows no code of its own. Its cells live in
``website/scripts/get_started_program.py``, one runnable file split by
``# %% cell: <id>`` markers, which ``website/scripts/generate_snippets.py``
executes to capture the output the page displays. This module executes the
same cells through the same splitter, so the page, the generator and this test
cannot drift apart: there is one source, and all three read it. The cells share
a single namespace and run in order, because that is how the page presents
them. See ``docs/programme/S10-portal-front-door.md``, decisions D3 and D4.

``website/walkthroughs/*.mdx`` holds the four walkthrough pages. Their fences
are ordinary Markdown code fences, so they reuse ``_extract_blocks`` from
``tests/test_docs_snippets.py`` rather than a second extractor; the markers
there are written ``{/* snippet: skip */}`` because MDX 3 rejects HTML
comments. A walkthrough executes in its own **fresh** namespace with no
pre-seeded fixture, cumulatively across that page's fences: a walkthrough must
run as shown, because a reader is meant to be able to reproduce it from what is
on the page. The result assertion is per page rather than per fence, since the
arc reaches a fit once.

These fences execute published prose, so this module carries the
``docs_execution`` marker that ``tests/conftest.py`` assigns to that tier.

See ``docs/programme/S08-the-four-walkthroughs.md``, decision D3.

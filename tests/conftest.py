"""Shared pytest configuration: worker thread pinning and role-based tiering.

Two concerns, both about how the suite is *run* rather than what it asserts.

Thread pinning. XLA sizes its CPU thread pool from the machine's core count, so
under `pytest-xdist` every worker independently tries to claim the whole host.
Even serially this suite spent 721s of system time against 824s of user time --
threads descheduling one another rather than computing -- and multiplying that
by the worker count made `-n 4` slower than no parallelism at all. Pinned, the
same tier runs in 106s with 12s of system time. Each worker therefore gets one
compute thread and the parallelism comes from xdist instead. This has to happen
before anything imports JAX, which is why it sits at conftest import time.

Tiering. The suite is split by what a test is *for*, not by how long it takes.
A plain ``uv run pytest`` still collects and runs everything, so the handoff
command in `AGENTS.md` keeps its meaning; CI splits the tiers into parallel
jobs with ``-m``.
